Stop to use deprecated method ssl.wrap_socket

ssl.wrap_socket is deprecated since python 3.7 and since python 3.2
and 2.7.9 (released in 2014) it is recommended to use the
SSLContext.wrap_socket() instead of wrap_socket() [1].

The top-level function (`ssl.wrap_socket`) is limited and creates an insecure
client socket without server name indication or hostname matching.

These changes move away from `ssl.wrap_socket` as recommanded in the official
documentation [1] by using `ssl.SSLContext.wrap_socket` [2].

Python 2.7 is now officially unmaintained and support have been dropped
previously in openstack, so now we only support python versions who are
compatible with these changes [3].
