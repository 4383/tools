Cap jsonschema 3.2.0 as the minimal version

Previous versions of jsonschema (<3.2.0) doesn't support python 3.8 [1].
Python 3.8 is part of the victoria supported runtimes [2] so we now force
to use jsonschema version 3.2.0 to avoid issues, remove ambiguity and ensure
that everything works with python 3 in general.
