Dropping lower constraints testing

We facing errors related to the new pip resolver, this
topic was discussed on the ML and QA team proposed to
to test lower-constraints [1].

I propose to drop this test because the complexity and recurring pain needed
to maintain that now exceeds the benefits provided by this mechanismes.
